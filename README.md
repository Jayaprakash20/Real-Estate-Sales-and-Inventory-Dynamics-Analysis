# Real-Estate-Sales-and-Inventory-Dynamics-Analysis 

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the use of Tableau as a dashboarding tool to uncover trends, patterns, and insights into real estate sales dynamics. Using a synthesized dataset modeled on real-world scenarios, the project explores key aspects of the housing market, including sales activity, market performance, and investment opportunities.   

**Breakthrough Insight:**  
The analysis identifies significant market trends, including conditions leading up to the 2007 housing market crisis—commonly referred to as "The Big Short." By visualizing metrics like housing sales, shares (e.g., BBB and AAA ratings), and profits, the project provides actionable insights for understanding past crises and predicting future opportunities. 

**Purpose:**  
This dashboard was designed to assist real estate stakeholders—including buyers, sellers, and investors—in understanding market trends and dynamics. It provides actionable insights to help maximize profits, avoid potential risks, and identify future investment opportunities.

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project was synthesized to reflect real-world housing market conditions. While the dataset itself is not included in this repository, the analysis focused on key metrics such as:  
- Number of listings sold city-wise.  
- Sales volume and median sales price.  
- Active listings.  

This dataset was modeled to simulate market trends leading to and following the 2007 housing market crisis. The insights and visualizations in this repository are based on this dataset.
